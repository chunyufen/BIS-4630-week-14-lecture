# Study hours outside class contact

&gt; “The study hours for each credit point is 10 hours. For a 30-credit module this equates to 300 hours. Therefore, if a module has time-tabled activities i.e. lecture/seminar/lab, of 3 hours per week for a 24-week period (total of 72 hours), then the out-of-class study commitment expected of students is 228 hours in total.” - Course Handbook.

* Practical meaning: 300 hours = **2.5 hours per day** x *5 days* x 24 learning weeks (Note: only 18 learning weeks for Hong Kong)

---

# Master's degree in UK

&gt; “[A] master's [degree] is hard work and requires a lot of commitment. It has to be something you actively want to do . . . Postgraduate study is *much more independent* than undergraduate study, so, on a practical level, it is important to be aware that you may be *working by yourself for much of the time*.” - [Taking the plunge into the master's world (The Guardian, 2009)](http://bit.ly/2fBScEa)

# Definition, Background &amp; Purposes of Corporate Governance

---

# British economy and market

&gt; "The country's economy depends on the drive and efficiency of its companies. Thus the effectiveness with which their boards discharge their responsibilities determines Britain's competitive position. They must be free to drive their companies forward, but exercise their freedom within a framework of effective accountability. This is the essence of any system of good corporate governance." - Cadbury Report

---

# British economy and market

&gt; "Avoiding an "expectation gap" by making the public aware that regulation cannot entirely eliminate fraud, malpractice or manipulation of the markets. The most important lesson from all the events is that high ethical and professional standards must always be put before commercial advantage. The reputation of the financial  markets depends on it." - Mirror Group Newspaper Plc, [Report](&lt;http://bit.ly/2k1HEOX&gt;) by the Hon Sir Roger John Laugharne Thomas and Raymond Thomas Turner FCA.

---

# Regulatory principle

* "Comply or explain"; "apply or explain"

&gt; "The UK Corporate Governance Code contains a complete section explaining how the “comply or explain” approach is applied in relation to the Code."

&gt; "The 'comply or explain' approach is the trademark of corporate governance in the UK. It has been in operation since the Code’s beginnings and is the foundation of the Code’s flexibility. It is strongly supported by both companies and shareholders and has been widely admired and imitated internationally." - Cadbury Report

---

# Corporate Governance:

* Sir Adrian Cadbury himself said in a speech made in 2000:

&gt; "Corporate governance is concerned with holding the balance between economic and social goals and between individual and communal goals. The corporate governance framework is there to encourage efficient use of resources and equally to require accountability for the stewardship of those resources. The aim is to align the interests of individuals, corporations and society."

---

# Corporate Governance:

* [Cadbury Report on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance published on 1 December 1992](http://bit.ly/1KRE27l):

&gt; "the system by which companies are directed and controlled"

* what are the key elements?


---

# Key elements

&gt; "The shareholders' role in governance is to appoint the directors and the auditors and to satisfy themselves that an appropriate governance structure is in place. The responsibilities of the board include setting the company's strategic aims, providing the leadership to put them into effect, supervising the management of the business and reporting to shareholders on their stewardship. The board's actions are subject to laws, regulations and the shareholders in general meeting." - Cadbury Report


---

# Key elements

* Shareholders' role in governance

    + appoint the directors and the auditors

    + satisfy themselves that an appropriate governance structure is in place


---

# Key elements

* Responsibilities of board of directors and auditors

    + setting the company's strategic aims

    + providing the leadership to put them into effect

    + subject to laws, regulations and the shareholders in general meeting


---

# Summary

&gt; "Governance codes are about due process and structure" - Mark Cardale

&gt; "Codes will not work effectively unless boardroom behaviours fulfill the intentions behind the process and structure." - Mark Cardale


---

# Business-focused objective for corporate governance

* Business objective

&gt; "Increase of shareholder value"

&gt; "Taking into account of the legitimate interests of stakeholders such as creditors, employees, suppliers, customers and the environment"

&gt; "controlling financial, business and operational risk"

&gt; "reducing the cost of capital"

* Practical objective

&gt; "put in place a "system" (to use the Cadbury corporate governance definition) or structure of direction and control which stands the best chance of delivering the business objective "


---

# A values-based understanding of governance - "soft" governance

* Chairman and CEO and board have the will to run their boards with values of

    + "honesty, trust and candour"

    + "integrity"

    + "openness"

    + "transparency"

    + "courage to dissent and ask awkward questions"

    + "willingness to debate"

* Resulting in

    + Sound and prudent business decisions

---

# Shareholder value

&gt; "boards to regard the enhancement of their owners' investments over time as their overriding objective"

---

# Enlightened shareholder value

&gt; "the basic goal for directors should be the success of the company in the collective best interests of shareholders, but that directors should also recognise, as circumstances require, the company's need to foster relationships with its employees, customers and suppliers, its need to maintain its business reputation, and its need to consider the company's impact on the community and the working environment."


---

# Stakeholder or pluralist approach

&gt; "the goal of shareholder value, whilst it clearly has to bear in mind the needs of "stakeholders" (customers, suppliers and employees, etc.), has failed particularly because it has not given due weight to such needs. The important issues of corporate governance lie deeper. What is the relationship between the structure of rules, laws and conventional practices within which companies operate and their style of management and the decisions which they make? There are increasingly widespread claims that the incentives, pressures and restraints on British managers lead to short-term decision-making and to failures to invest in physical equipment, in people and in the development of businesses, and that these factors are ultimately profoundly damaging to Britain's economic performance."


---

# What is shareholder value

&gt; "most obviously the term will imply a search for continuing increases in the value of a company's shares and/or the "yield" on those shares."

* long-term shareholder value

&gt; "To sustainably create value, companies need to develop  strategies that exploit or provide them with a competitive  advantage over their competitors and apply appropriate  operational and financial disciplines. In order to succeed in  the long term, companies will need to manage effectively  relationships with key stakeholders and have regard for the  environment and society as a whole. Companies adhering to our  over-riding principle of creating long-term value for  shareholders will not only create sustainable value for their  shareholders but also benefit stakeholders and the wider economy  and society in which they participate."


---

# Composition of directors

* a chairman

* a chief executive officer, who may be a different individual from the person who is a chairman

* members with "the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the company to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively."

&gt; "an appropriate combination of executive and non-executive directors, and a board appointed "on merit, against objective criteria and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the board, including gender.""


---

# Composition of directors

* at least half the board, excluding the chairman, would comprise non-executive directors determined by the board to be "independent"

* the number of "independent" non-executive directors would be at least three (except in the case of smaller companies, when two is the minimum)

* at least one member of the audit committee would have "recent and relevant financial experience"

* a senior independent director from among the independent non-executive directors


---

# Size of board

&gt; "should be of sufficient size that the requirements of the business can be met and that changes to the board's composition and that of its committees can be managed without undue disruption, and should be not so large as to be unwieldy."


---

# Committees within Board

* At least 3 standing committees

    + Audit Committee

    + Remuneration Committee (Remco)

    + Nomination Committee

* Risk Committee

* Corporate Governance Committee


---

# Sarbanes-Oxley Act (US)

* [SOX](http://bit.ly/2kGv1LS) Passed on 30 July 2002

* Steve Giles. Managing Fraud Risk: A Practical Guide for Directors and Managers. page 130. (MDX eBook)

&gt; "The SOX is a comprehensive piece of legislation, arranged into 11 "titles" or "sections."" (Giles)

---

# Sarbanes-Oxley Act (US)

&gt; "It introduced major changes to the regulation of corporate governance and financial practice for all companies listed on one of the US exchanges and therefore regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, wherever situated around the world. It is named after Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Michael Oxley, who were its main architects." (Giles)

&gt; "The law was passed as a direct response to concerns in the investor community following the bankruptcies of Enron in particular in December 2001, but also those of Global Crossing in January 2002 and WorldCom in July 2002." (Giles)


---

# Sarbanes-Oxley Act (US)

&gt; "All accounting firms wishing to audit US listed companies are now required to register with the (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of the Securities and Exchange Commission)." (Giles)


---

# Sarbanes-Oxley Act (US)

* Four measures taken by SEC

&gt; (1) "Prohibiting an auditor from undertaking certain specified non-audit services at the same time as performing the audit. These services include: bookkeeping; internal audit; and the design and implementation of financial information systems." (Giles)

&gt; (2) "Introducing an element of auditor rotation by prohibiting an audit partner from being the leader reviewing auditor for more than five consecutive years." (Giles)

---

# Sarbanes-Oxley Act (US)

* Four measures taken by SEC

&gt; (3) "Placing a one-year prohibition on an audit firm from performing the audit if one of the company's senior executives had been employed by the same firm and had participated in the audit of the company during the previous year" (Giles)

&gt; (4) "Requiring that audit firms report more fully to the audit committee on contentious matters ..." (Giles)

---

# Sarbanes-Oxley Act (US)

&gt; "Perhaps the most notorious and costly of all the extra requirements on listed companies under the SOX are the Section 404 provisions concerning management's assessment of the internal controls surrounding the financial reporting process." (Giles)


---

# Sarbanes-Oxley Act (US)

&gt; "Section 404 requires companies to publish an internal control report as part of their annual report, concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This internal control report must also assess the effectiveness of such controls and procedures. In addition, an external accounting firm must attest to, and report on, the company's assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting (the so-called attestation report)." (Giles)


---

# Sarbanes-Oxley Act (US)

* Deterrence provisions:

&gt; "Establishes criminal penalties of fines and/or up to 20 years' imprisonment for knowingly altering, destroying, mutilating, concealing or falsifying records with the intention to obstruct, impede or influence either a Federal investigation or a matter of bankruptcy." (Giles)

&gt; "Establishes criminal penalties of fines and/or imprisonment of up to 10 years on any accountant who knowingly and wilfully violates the requirement to maintain all audit or review papers for a period of five years." (Giles)


---

# Sarbanes-Oxley Act (US)

* Deterrence provisions

&gt; "Subjects to fine or imprisonment of up to 25 years any person who knowingly defrauds share-holders of publicly traded companies." (Giles)

&gt; "Provides increased penalties for mail and wire fraud from five to 20 years in prison." (Giles)


---

# Sarbanes-Oxley Act (US)

* Deterrence provisions

&gt; "Provides increased penalties for violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 1974 of up to $500,000 and/or 10 years in prison." (Giles)

&gt; "Establishes criminal liability for the failure of corporate officers to certify reports, including a maximum imprisonment of 10 years for knowing that the report does not comply with the Act, or 20 years for wilfully certifying a statement knowing it does not comply with the Act." (Giles)

# OECD Corporate Governance Definition

* [OECD Principles of Corporate Governance 1999](http://bit.ly/2BQQPZF)

* [OECD Principles of Corporate Governance 2004](http://bit.ly/2E8N7zT)

* [G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance (2015)](http://bit.ly/2jygiBa)

&gt; "Corporate governance involves a set of relationships between a company's management, its board, its shareholders and other stakeholders. Corporate governance also provides the structure through which the objectives of the company are set, and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring performance are determined." - 1999, 2004 &amp; 2015

&gt; "The corporate governance framework should ensure the strategic guidance of the company, the effective monitoring of management by the board, and the board's accountability to the company and the shareholders." - 2004

---

# Principles of Corporate Governance (2015)

* [G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance (2015)](http://bit.ly/2jygiBa)

&gt; "Ensuring the basis for an effective corporate governance framework"

&gt; "The corporate governance framework should promote transparent and fair markets, and the efficient allocation of resources. It should be consistent with the rule of law and support effective supervision and enforcement."


---

# Principles of Corporate Governance (2015)

&gt; "The rights and equitable treatment of shareholders and key ownership functions"

&gt; "The corporate governance framework should protect and facilitate the exercise of shareholders' rights and ensure the equitable treatment of all shareholders, including minority and foreign shareholders. All shareholders should have the opportunity to obtain effective redress for violation of their rights."

&gt; "Institutional investors, stock markets, and other intermediaries"

&gt; "The corporate governance framework should provide sound incentives throughout the investment chain and provide for stock markets to function in a way that contributes to good corporate governance."


---

# Principles of Corporate Governance (2015)

&gt; "The role of stakeholders in corporate governance"

&gt; "The corporate governance framework should recognise the rights of stakeholders established by law or through mutual agreements and encourage active co-operation between corporations and stakeholders in creating wealth, jobs, and the sustainability of financially sound enterprises."

&gt; "Disclosure and transparency"

&gt; "The corporate governance framework should ensure that timely and accurate disclosure is made on all material matters regarding the corporation, including the financial situation, performance, ownership, and governance of the company."


---

# Principles of Corporate Governance (2015)

&gt; " The responsibilities of the board"

&gt; "The corporate governance framework should ensure the strategic guidance of the company, the effective monitoring of management by the board, and the board's accountability to the company and the shareholders."


---

# Risk Management &amp; Corporate Governance (2014)

* [OECD Risk Management and Corporate Governance (2014)](http://bit.ly/2kbxxsW)

&gt; "(It) reviews the corporate governance framework and practices relating to corporate risk management in 27 of the jurisdictions that participate in the OECD Corporate Governance Committee. Against the background of the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, it describes how various jurisdictions have chosen to implement the Principles relating to risk management."


---

# Corporate Governance of Financial Groups (2016)

* [OECD Corporate Governance Working Papers No. 20: Corporate Governance of Financial Groups (2016)](http://bit.ly/2kbbCls)

&gt; "The headquarters at the ultimate parent home location oversee all the businesses within the group, develop the group wide strategy and give directions to the member subsidiaries. The boards and management of the subsidiaries are expected to follow general or specific directions. They are practically obliged to do so, as the directions are backed by the parent's controlling power based on shareholding."


---

# Corporate Governance of Financial Groups (2016)

&gt; "In contrast to this reality, many company laws around the world stipulate the fiduciary duty of board directors of a company that require them to act in the best interest of the company, not for the interest of the majority shareholder. ...However, (interests of parent company and subsidiary) can come into conflict occasionally, which then puts the subsidiary directors into a dilemma. Where they perceive that the direction of the parent is not for the best interest of the company, they need legally to refuse such a direction, otherwise they could face civil and criminal charges, although such refusal often seems unrealistic."


---

# Corporate Governance of Financial Groups (2016)

* There appears to be essentially two different approaches for this problem:

&gt; "The first approach is to establish the legal framework to permit the parent company to exercise directions over its subsidiary for the interest of the group or the parent. In return for this authority, the parent would bear the special liability for the loss incurred in the subsidiary by its influence, which provides the protection for the minority shareholders and creditors of the subsidiary."

&gt; "The second approach to address the legal dilemma of subsidiary
 directors is to allow them to act in the interest of the group. This approach has been developed mainly in the courts."


---

# Corporate Governance of Financial Groups (2016)

* How UK deals with the problem?

&gt; "Traditionally the United Kingdom adheres to the concept of
fiduciary loyalty of directors to the company, and its courts have upheld firmly the principle of separate legal entity. Therefore, the governance issues associated with corporate groups are also dealt with by the general corporate law provisions applied to standalone companies. However, this does not mean that directors of a subsidiary company cannot take into consideration the interest of the group or the parent in their decision making. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 stipulates that a director of a company must have regard to various factors including the likely consequences of any decision in the long term."


---

# Applying the OECD principles

* [Using the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance - a Boardroom Perspective](http://bit.ly/2EBpehY) (2008)

&gt; "The intention was to illuminate how the aspirations of the OECD Principles can be practically achieved in different regulatory, economic and cultural contexts, within which directors face similar challenges – many of which cannot be easily overcome."

&gt; "The experiences of directors and practitioners in using the OECD Principles in a world that is necessarily characterised by incomplete law are of particular importance. How do board members, in performing their
everyday functions, fill the gaps that laws, regulations and guidelines cannot, and should not, fill?"

---

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

* Principle 3: Board's own structure and practices

The chair should ensure that board decisions are taken on a sound and well informed basis. The chair should encourage and promote critical discussion and ensure that dissenting views can be freely expressed and discussed within the decision-making process.

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

* Principle 5: Governance of group structures

&gt; Parent company boards: "In operating within a group structure, the board of the parent company should be aware of the material risks and issues that might affect both the bank as a whole and its subsidiaries. It should exercise adequate oversight over subsidiaries while respecting the independent legal and governance responsibilities that might apply to subsidiary boards."


---

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

* Principle 5: Governance of group structures

&gt; Subsidiary boards: "Subsidiary boards and senior management remain responsible for developing effective risk management processes for their entities. The methods and procedures applied by subsidiaries should support the effectiveness of risk management at a group level. While parent companies should conduct strategic, group-wide risk management and prescribe corporate risk policies, subsidiary management and boards should have appropriate input to their local or regional application and to the assessment of local risks. ..."


---

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

* Principle 5: Governance of group structures

&gt; Subsidiary boards: "...While parent companies should conduct strategic, group-wide risk management and prescribe corporate risk policies, subsidiary management and boards should have appropriate input to their local or regional application and to the assessment of local risks. Parent companies should ensure that adequate tools and authorities are available to the subsidiary and that the subsidiary understands the reporting obligations it has to the head office. It is the responsibility of subsidiary boards to assess the compatibility of group policy with local legal and regulatory requirements and, where appropriate, amend those policies."


---

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

* Principle 5: Governance of group structures

&gt; Complex or opaque structures: "Banks create structures for legal, regulatory and tax purposes. ...Operating through complex or non-transparent structures may pose financial, legal, reputational and other risks to the bank.

---

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

* Principle 6: Risk management function

&gt; Role of the CRO: "Large, complex and internationally active banks, and other banks, based on their risk profile and local governance requirements, should have a senior manager (CRO or equivalent) with overall responsibility for the bank's risk management function. In banking groups, there should be a group CRO in addition to subsidiary-level risk officers."


---

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

* Principle 6: Risk management function

&gt; "The CRO has primary responsibility for overseeing the development and implementation of the bank's risk management function. ...The CRO should have the organisational stature, authority and necessary skills to oversee the bank's risk management activities. The CRO should be independent and have duties distinct from other executive functions. This requires the CRO to have access to any information necessary to perform his or her duties."


---

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

* Principle 6: Risk management function

&gt; "While formal reporting lines may vary across banks, the CRO should report and have direct access to the board or its risk committee without impediment. The CRO should have the ability to interpret and articulate risk in a clear and understandable manner and to effectively engage the board and management in constructive dialogue on key risk issues. Interaction between the CRO and the board and/or risk committee should occur regularly, and the CRO should have the ability to meet with the board or risk committee without executive directors being present"


---

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

* Principle 7: Risk identification, monitoring and controlling

&gt; "Risks should be identified, monitored and controlled on an ongoing bank-wide and individual entity basis. The sophistication of the bank's risk management and internal control infrastructure should keep pace with changes to the bank's risk profile, to the external risk landscape and in industry practice"


---

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

* Principle 8: Risk communication

&gt; "An effective risk governance framework requires robust communication within the bank about risk, both across the organisation and through reporting to the board and senior management."


---

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

* Principle 9: Compliance

&gt; "The bank's board of directors is responsible for overseeing the management of the bank's compliance risk. The board should establish a compliance function and approve the bank's policies and processes for identifying, assessing, monitoring and reporting and advising on compliance risk."


---

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

---

# Corporate Governance Principles for Banks (2015)

* Principle 13: The role of supervisors (regulator)

&gt; Comprehensive evaluations of a bank's corporate governance: "Supervisors should have processes in place to fully evaluate a bank's corporate governance. Such evaluations may be conducted through regular reviews of written materials and reports, interviews with board members and bank personnel, examinations, self-assessments by the bank, and other types of on- and off-site monitoring. The evaluations should also include regular communication with a bank's board of directors, senior management, those responsible for the risk, compliance and internal audit functions, and external auditors."

&gt; "The corporate governance framework for listed companies in the European Union is a combination of legislation and 'soft law', including recommendations and corporate governance codes" (quoted from Green Paper)

&gt; "Directive 2006/46/EC promotes their application by requiring that listed companies refer in their corporate governance statement to a code and that they report on their application of that code on a 'comply or explain' basis." (quoted from Green Paper)


---

# EU Directive 2006/46/EC

* Article 46a, paragraph 1:

&gt; "A company whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market within the meaning of Article 4(1), point (14) of Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments shall include a corporate governance statement in its annual report.

---

# The EU Corporate Governance Framework (2011)

* [EU Green Paper: The EU Corporate Governance Framework (2011)](http://bit.ly/2jYYXPE)

&gt; "It is of paramount importance that European businesses demonstrate the utmost responsibility not only towards their employees and shareholders but also towards society at large"

&gt; "Corporate governance is traditionally defined as the system by which companies are directed and controlled and as a set of relationships between a company's management, its board, its shareholders and its other stakeholders."


---

# The EU Corporate Governance Framework (2011)

&gt; "To identify the issues most relevant to good corporate governance in the EU and to prepare this Green Paper, the Commission conducted interviews with a sample of listed companies from different Member States and different economic sectors, with different levels of capitalisation and different shareholding structures."

* three subjects which are at the heart of good corporate governance

    + The board of directors

    + Shareholders

    + How to apply comply or explain approach


---

# The EU Corporate Governance Framework (2011)

* The board of directors

&gt; "High performing, effective boards are needed to challenge executive management. This means that boards need non-executive members with diverse views, skills and appropriate professional experience. Such members must also be willing to invest sufficient time in the work of the board. The role of chairman of the board is particularly important, as are the board's responsibilities for risk management"


---

# The EU Corporate Governance Framework (2011)

* Shareholders

&gt; "the corporate governance framework is built on the assumption that shareholders engage with companies and hold the management to account for its performance. However, there is evidence that the majority of shareholders are passive and are often only focused on short-term profits. It therefore seems useful to consider whether more shareholders can be encouraged to take an interest in sustainable returns and longer term performance, and how to encourage them to be more active on corporate governance issues. Moreover, in different shareholding structures there are other issues, such as minority protection."


---

# The EU Corporate Governance Framework (2011)

* Failure in "apply comply or explain" approach

&gt; "A recent study showed that the informative quality of explanations published by companies departing from the corporate governance code's recommendation is - in the majority of the cases - not satisfactory and that in many Member States there is insufficient monitoring of the application of the codes. It is therefore appropriate to consider how to improve this situation."
